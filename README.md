# Elevate: Empowering Homeless Individuals through Community Support and Crowdfunding

## Project Overview

Elevate is an innovative crowdfunding platform designed to bridge the gap between donors and homeless individuals by fostering direct, transparent relationships. Our mission is to provide personalized support, enable accountability and transparency, and build community engagement to address the homelessness crisis.

This project was developed for Cal Hacks, leveraging Hume AI for emotion analysis and SingleStore for efficient data management.

## The Problem

Homelessness remains a persistent and complex challenge in cities across the U.S. As of 2024:
- Approximately 7,200 individuals experience homelessness in San Francisco
- Family homelessness has increased by 94% since 2022
- Over 580,000 people experience homelessness on any given night in the United States

Traditional solutions have not kept pace with the inflow of new individuals and families becoming homeless.

## Our Solution

Elevate provides a platform for social workers, volunteers, or community members to become sponsors of homeless individuals, sharing their stories, advocating on their behalf, and raising funds to support their transition out of homelessness.

### Key Features

1. **Personalized Profiles**: Each homeless individual has a dedicated profile including:
   - Photo
   - Audio story (analyzed by Hume AI for emotion insights)
   - Written transcript/blog

2. **Sponsorship and Fundraising**: Crowdfunding pages for essential needs (shelter, clothing, food, healthcare)

3. **Impact Updates**: Regular updates on tangible results and progress

4. **Community Sharing**: Easy social media sharing and progress tracking for donors

5. **Emotion Analysis**: Utilizing Hume AI to analyze audio stories for deeper emotional understanding

6. **Efficient Data Management**: Powered by SingleStore for fast, scalable data processing

## Technology Stack

## Implementation Plan

1. **Initial Launch**: Pilot program in San Francisco
2. **Platform Development**: User-friendly profiles with integrated payment processing

4. **Growth and Expansion**: Scale to other cities facing similar challenges

## Potential Challenges and Mitigations
